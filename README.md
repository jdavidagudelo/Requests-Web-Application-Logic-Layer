Requests-Web-Application
====================================

In this repository I include the most of the projects I have developed during my time studying 
Systems engineering at the University of Antioquia at Medellin Colombia.


The project Called SolicitudesSpringGitHubGit contains a java project that implements the Logic Layer of a web
application using the framework Spring. It can be used just by Downloading the required libraries and
including them inside the java build path in an IDE like Eclipse.

The project called SolicitudesGWTGit contains a Java project that implements the Presentation and view layers of a
web application using the framework GWT. 

The project called Gramatica was developed in order to create a simple Grammar for the subject of Languages 
Theory at the University. It simply contains all the data structures required to create and process a basic grammar
and some algorithms in order to transform it.

The project called Tree Includes some implementations of trees created for the subject of Logic Three at the University.
